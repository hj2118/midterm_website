          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Support for Shin Lee, a Korean traditional wrestling genius.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Issue</h3>
          <p>Shin Lee, who is a middle school student, is a Korean tradition wrestling genius who won three gold medals in a national competition three months after starting the wrestling in the fifth grade of elementary school. Although he has maintained excellent performance every year in various competitions so far, unfortunately, the background of North Korean defectors and difficult family circumstances hamper this promising student in the future.</p>
          <p>Shin Lee's mother defected to China while having Shin Lee, and they lived in China until 2009. Shin Lee had linguistic and cultural difficulties in re-adapting to Korea. Also, he grew up hearing all those people saying abusive words because he is a North Korean defector.</p>
          <p>Shin Lee's mother was hospitalized for back pain two months after she started working in South Korea. However, even after several surgeries, she was unable to engage in economic activities due to mobility difficulties. Although the government is providing basic recipient subsidies, it is far from enough for Lee Shin, his mother, and his twin sister to live.</p>
          <p>Even in these difficult situations, Shin Lee goes to school at 7:30 a.m. every day, exercises in the morning, and participates in the wrestling training from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. after school. In other times, he takes charge of housework on behalf of his sick mother and younger sister.</p>
          <p>The only wish of this student is the health and happiness of his family. He thinks the only way to success and gain happiness is by Korean traditional wrestling, so he is trying his best even in the difficult environments.</p>
