          <p>Support children with Down's Syndrome to live healthy and have high values</p>

          <h3>Issue</h3>
          <p>
            There are children who cannot go out as well as go to school because of other people's eyes.
            Down's syndrome is also known as "Angel Disease" due to their patience, service spirit, and affection.
            These children have endless dreams and talents, but are suffering from implicit social gaze and prejudice.
          </p>
          <p>
            The wrong justice created by the few is deeply embedded in society, creating a social atmosphere full of unconscious prejudices.
            However, turning this prejudice back to a positive perspective also starts with a few.
            Give Orange hopes that these social walls will break down and children suffering from Down's syndrome will dream freely under equal conditions with others.
          </p>
          <p>For children suffering from Down's syndrome, small sharing is an opportunity and gift to realize their dreams.
            Please participate in the small changes so that angels can wing freely with dreams and hopes!
          </p>
