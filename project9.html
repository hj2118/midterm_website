          <h3>Issue</h3>
          <p>
            Teenagers turning 18 have to leave nurseries in South Korea.
            Those just become the age of 18 are considered adults, who do not need any carings from other adults.
            There are thousands of people each year who have to start living alone.
            Most get short-term part-time jobs for a living as soon as they come out of the nurseries.
            They put their dreams behind them and work hard all the time.
            They live by covering the monthly rent of their studios by themselves day by day.
            They do not have any time to dream.
