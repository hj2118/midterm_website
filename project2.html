          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Support a child named Jaehoon, who lives in shantytown</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Issue</h3>
          <p>Next to the skyscrapers, there is a place where 1,100 generations live together in an unimaginable place. This is the last unauthorized shantytown in Seoul South Korea, quite different from what people know of the city. Residents of this town are worried about poor living conditions, relying on briquettes, candles, and communal toilets due to poor water supply, electricity, and gas distribution.</p>
          <p>Children who were exposed to this environment had not even been issued their resident registration numbers until a few years ago, so they did not receive basic education. There is a kid who is in the second grade of elementary school. His dad is a daily service worker, and his mom works as a cleaner, living hard day by day.</p>
          <p>However, even though his parents work hard, without any time to rest, the kid lives in a collapsing house exposed to various disaster accidents such as fires. This project was to show the kid a steady little interest, putting a ladder of hope on him.</p>
