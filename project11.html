          <h3>Issue</h3>
          <p>
            There are taxi drivers who are deaf. Silent taxis are special taxis
            designed for communication between passengers and taxi drivers with
            hearing impairments. The drivers of silent taxis are leading an
            independent lives with excellent work skills, breaking the prejudice
            that their communication and driving will be difficult. The drivers
            can communicate with passengers and operate more safely through
            customized tablet PCs. People may have the prejudices unconsciously,
            but through this project, the world will change.
