          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            Togle is an organization that fosters marriage migrant women
            who are experiencing career breaks as foreign language conversation
            instructors to help them engage in economic activities and self-realization.
          </p>

          <h3>Issue</h3>
          <p>
            In fact, the majority of talented marriage migrant women are having
            difficulty finding jobs due to social prejudice. Togle is an
            organization that started to realize opportunities to become
            socially and economically independent by hiring migrant women as
            native speakers. It is not just a service that teaches second
            languages, but is creating a "global dialogue window" where Koreans
             and foreigners share and understand each other's languages and
             cultures.</p>
          <p>As director Bong, Joon-ho once said, "If you jump over an inch of
            barrier, it will open to the global world," please help everyone to
            naturally accept multiculturalism and coexist beyond language barriers.
          </p>
