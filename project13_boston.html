          <h3>Issue</h3>
          <p>H!Cycle Co. is a social enterprise that provides environmental
             welfare through upcycling coffee bags and coffee scraps.
            Upcycle refers to being reborn as a product for a new purpose
            by adding an eco-friendly design to an abandoned product.
            Recently, there were natural disasters caused by abnormal weather
            such as forest fires in Australia and signs of volcanic eruptions
            in the Philippines. Therefore, the interests in upcycling has rised.
            Help H!Cycle Co. to settle upcycling culture to this world.
