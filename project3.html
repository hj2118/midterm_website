          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>This project was to support Sungha from a multicultural family. He lived in a local children's center.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Issue</h3>
          <p>This project supports a photography club called "Photographers Taking Dreams" in a childcare facility, where male children aged 3 to 18 live. Those children take pictures of their dreams.
            They were awarded a lot in various competitions. They are looking at the world with different eyes through camera lenses.
            However, due to recent financial difficulties and lack of support, they could not take pictures anymore as they did back then. They are looking at the world from a different perspective and expand their perspective on the external society and environment through one means of "photography."
            This project helps devloping the children's artistic potential and view of the world. It definitely plays an essential role in dreaming and planning for their bright future.</p>
