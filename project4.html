          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>A scholarship project for a female college student who is at 5:31 AM.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Issue</h3>
          <p>A female college student  who started living in a nursery at 5. Since she is now an adult, she has to earn all her tuition and living expenses on her own without parents or relatives to help her. When her friends worry about their grades, dating, and employment, she worries mostly about living expenses other than tuition and utility bills. She spends the whole day worrying about her livelihood, with no financial and mental room to invest in her future. Every night, she dreams of a "normal day" without worrying about financial problems.</p>
