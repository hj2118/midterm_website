          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>For Jong-Hoon Lee, who was a Korean War veteran.</p>
          <br>

          <h3>Issue</h3>
          <p>Jong-Hoon Lee is a veteran of the Korean War, which was the war between South Korea and North Korea.
            During the Korean War, numerous young people participated and fought bloodlessly for the country,
            but now it is a forgotten history for many people. Many of the veterans and their descendents
            are living in a harsh environment these days, without any kind of compensation. Therefore, this project
            is to think once again and remember the Korean War and its veterans and show some respect
            for the noble sacrifices of the veterans.</p>
