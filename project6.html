          <h3>Issue</h3>
          <p>
            Baby box started with the aim of helping a few single moms unable to raise their children or abandon their children due to social difficulties.
            However, these days, about 200 precious lives arrive in the baby box on a daily basis. Most babies arrive here with letters from their mothers.
            There is only one baby box in South Korea, and this project was to support the pastor who runs that baby box. The small changes will help children's dreams to settle and bloom.

          <h3>Letter from Mother âœ‰</h3>
          <p class="letter">I'm a single mother. Everything is my fault. This is the only way I've got.</p>
            <p class="letter">I had looked into various adoption procedures, but I
              had no choice beside this due to an Adoption Special Act, which records that my baby was adopted.
              Some people tell their parents to raise them, but I can't take the courage to do that.
              That's why I'm bad mother who gives my son a lifelong wound on this cold day.
              Please forgive me for having no choice but to leave him in the baby box.</p>
            <p class="letter">I thought everything would be solved if I died with Jun-young, but I couldn't when I looked at Junyoun's eyes, which look like mine.
               Happiness is the only thing I can give to my child, so I wondered if there would be a way for Junyoung to live a blessed life instead of me,
               and I found out about the baby box. Please. Please raise Junyoung happily and safely instead of me.</p>
           <p class="letter">I'm not in a situation where I can raise the child by myself.
             It's a decision that I made after contemplating and contemplating for thousands of times.
             I want you to know that my heart is torning apart to send my son away from me.</p>
           <p class="letter">My son's name is Junyoung. Please let him enjoy the care and love that I have not given to Junyoung.
              I know it's a shameless request, but please take good care of Junyoung.</P>
            <p class="letter">I'll definitely come back to find him. Until then, please take care of my son.</p>
            <p class="letter">All of this is my selfishness, but please take good care of my son so that he can be loved and raised here or anywhere until then.</p>
            <p class="letter">Junyoung's mom</p>
